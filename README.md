# CSE 3502: Project 1 Multi-Threaded Programming and IPC

## Overview 
In this project I was able to dive into two important aspects that operating systems provide: multi-threading as well as interprocess communication. I was able to explore all the difficulties that come with thread synchronization, deadlock handling, and communications through pipes, by implementing this multi-threaded banking system. 

To do this the project is made up of two main parts
1. **Multi-Threading Implementation: The demonstration of thread synchronization and deadlock resolution shown in a banking simulation 
2. ** IPC Implementation: A producer to consumer model that uses pipes to pass data between the processes

## Repository Structure
- **'code/'**: Contains all the C# source code for the implementations of multi-threading and IPC.
- **'report/'**:Contains the LaTeX source files and the compiled PDF report 
- **'README.md'**: Provides an overview of the project as well as the instructions for setup and usage 
##Setup Instructions
